"This project was originally named "Phase", referencing the changes and phases that we can go through. Our perspectives on our current obsessions, hobbies, careers, and / or all of the above can completely change over time in ways that are only seen in hindsight. As I spent dozens to hundreds of hours working on this project, it occurred to me that my time with keyboards was possibly just a phase. It was eventually given the updated moniker "Moment" to preserve its time-focused theme, while avoiding any existing naming conflicts.

Having been over two years since its initial draft, this project now solidifies the defining Moment where I decided to step deeper into the world of keyboard design."
