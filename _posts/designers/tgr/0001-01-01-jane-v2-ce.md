"There have been some designed changes made to optimise it for larger production, and also to distinguish it from the original v2.
- Additional key is placed between the F12 and PrtSc.
- Stainless steel back plate is replaced with carbon fibre.
- Matte polished instead of mirror polished stainless steel weight (coated in black)
- The brass weight is repositioned inside the case, centred about the alphanumeric keys.
