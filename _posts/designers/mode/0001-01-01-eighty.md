"Elegant minimalist design. Crafted with care.

Each Eighty starts its life as a solid block of 6063 aluminum, which is then precision machined to a sleek, angular form. Every case then undergoes numerous steps of extensive hand polishing, sandblasting, and anodization for a pleasant satin texture that’s built to last.
