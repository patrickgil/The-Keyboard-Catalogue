"The Envoy is Mode Designs’ latest iteration of the 65% keyboard layout. Whether you’re working from home, in the office, or gaming - the Envoy
has hundreds of combinations to help you craft your perfect keyboard.

We’ve partnered with Carbon 3D, utilizing the Carbon DLS™ 3D printing process to develop an elastomeric blocks which offer a uniquely bouncy
typing feel or a classic stiffer typing experience. The whole system is secured by two fasteners that prevent the internal assembly from moving
upwards but have no impact on downwards movement.
