"Hong Kong is home to more skyscrapers than any other city in the world. Our skyline is dotted with iconic buildings that helped author the
 style of our keyboard. In particular, the textured layout on the sides was inspired by the BOC building. The numerous skyscrapers facing
 Victoria Harbour are characterised with smooth window surfaces supported by curtain walls and steel frames. Drawing inspiration from these
 visual elements, we decided to create a keyboard with a seamless design accompanied by a stainless steel weight."
