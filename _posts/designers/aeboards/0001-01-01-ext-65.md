"Earlier this year we released our flagship keyboard; [Aegis](/aeboards/aegis).  The design came from a place of looking at keyboards through the lens of aesthetics, observation of usage, and affordance. This helped define our core pillars: functional elegance, ergonomics, and experience.

Over the last couple of months we were hard at work designing on what we had learnt through the Aegis, watching the current trends, and also pushing ourselves with innovative and courageous thinking. This has led to our next board; the **Extended 65**.
