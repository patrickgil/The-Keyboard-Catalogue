"I originally made this board around a year and half ago and it was a small private group buy for some friends. After all the time that we have spent with the board, it has become a mainstay on many desks. For this I am extremely grateful and proud, that people use a keyboard I made and enjoy it so much that it got to the top of their rotation."
