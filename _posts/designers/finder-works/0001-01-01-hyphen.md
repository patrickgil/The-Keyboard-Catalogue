"The Hyphen is a WKL only 60% keyboard that uses single sided compression mounting. Unforgivingly flexy due to it's half plate and WeirdFlex PCB - heavier typists may be able to bottom out with more extreme typing force.

In an age of keyboard design where its almost encouraged to include foam and make modifications during the build to homogenise the typing feel and sound i wanted to explore the opposite end of the spectrum – The Hyphen is intended to embrace identity, I believe it is the softest, most unapologetic typing experience, making no effort to appeal to everyone.

Simple application of strong design principles keeps the board looking classic with it’s mid-2000s era Kustom feel.
