"This board is a revival of one of the much loved kustoms - the OTD 360C. Similar aesthetic, build and mounting style but i believe i have changed enough to take it well out of clone territory. While it does draw heavily from the original source I believe that the changes i have made are enough to make it my own. Shifting proportions and updating internals while offering more flexibility in layout. The plate has different mounting points but has all of the Korean flex/consistency cutouts as after all, people do crave the typing experience of a Kustom for a reason. More or less its designed to look and feel like a Kustom that has been given a breath of fresh air.
