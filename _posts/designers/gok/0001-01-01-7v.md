"7V was the realisation of everything that I wanted in a keyboard at the time.

The concept behind the aesthetic design language was to give the weight a 3-dimensional presence rather than
only being able to appreciate a single face which is often the case. This idea was derived from my architectural background where I believe that materials should have authentic substance as opposed to things like wood veneers or wallpaper.

The exploded 75% layout had all the keys I wanted from the TKL form-factor but in a condensed package.
