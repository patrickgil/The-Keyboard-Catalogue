"The Austin was created with the intention of providing a layout that included a full size numpad without being a full sized board. For those who use the numpad on a daily basis or have the muscle memory of using it for any or all numbers, transitioning to a numpadless keyboard or a keyboard with a 1u '0' can be difficult. The 2u '0' is the spacebar for numbers and having to adjust your thumb to accomodate for a 1u '0' will annoy even the best bean counters. The Austin provides an all-in-one package for the keyboard enthusiast who wants a high end keyboard for their home or office needs.
