## Changelog:

#### No. 2 Rev. 1

Unlike the No. 1 Rev. 1, this revision to the No. 2 is very minor, largely to address feedback from customers. Changes include:

  -  Minor changes to internals and clearances
  -  New plate design for increased flex (compatible with original release, details TBA)
  -  Case height increased slightly so that keycaps appear to sit lower in the case (actual height from desk to plate is unchanged)
  -  New custom-molded silicone bumpon feet (compatible with original release)

#### No. 2 Rev. 2

The No. 2 Rev. 2 is the first batch of No. 2's manufactured in Raleigh, NC. No. 2 Rev. 2 parts are not compatible with previous revisions.

  -  Small internal changes to help with manufacturing, the aesthetics of the keyboard are the same
  -  PTFE alignment pins
