"Originally released in 2017, the No. 1 tenkeyless keyboard was sold in a small, private group buy that never sought out the attention it eventually received. Nearly two years later, we're coming back to the design.
<br>
Using what we've learned in the meantime, the No. 1 Rev. 1 is rebuilt from the ground up. No parts are compatible with the original board – from major architectural changes like the incorporation of a USB-C daughterboard to subtle shifts in the curvatures of the case, everything is different. We think this revision is more refined than its predecessor, and we sincerely hope you enjoy it."
