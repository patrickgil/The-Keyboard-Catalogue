# Keycult No. 1/60

ref link: [Keycult Website Listing](https://keycult.com/pages/no-1-60-no-1-65)

"No. 1/60 and No. 1/65 are an evolution of the original No. 1 tenkeyless design. While they share an external aesthetic with that original design, the keyboard internals have been reworked."

## Rev. 1
Much like the TKL release in June, this release is a revision to the original. While the plates are compatible, no other case components are. We've taken the lessons learned from a year of designing and producing keyboards and wrapped them up in this revision. Changes include:

  -  PTFE plate-alignment pins
  -  Leaf-spring plate for added flex
  -  VIA-compatible WT60-A and USB-C daughterboard designed by [Wilba](/wilba/)
