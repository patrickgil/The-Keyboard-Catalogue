# About

The Keyboard Catalogue is a searchable database displaying all custom mechanical keyboards and their specifications. I found that there was a
distinct lack of information surrounding many custom keyboards. I sought out to fix this issue. The Keyboard Catalogue is a work in progress
and all help is appreciated.

Do you have a board/designer you would like to add? Open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/patrickgil/The-Keyboard-Catalogue/issues).
